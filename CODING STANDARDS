Expected coding format as follows

1. Tabs = 2 spaces. Use space instead of Tab character.
2. Separate smaller blocks with a blank line.
3. Well commented. If you wish to submit a pull request make sure your username is
   in your comments somewhere so you can maintain direct credit visibly in your 
   submitted code.
4. I welcome simplications and constructive criticism. Don't be an ass about it though.

Thus far my contributions are from my personal learning process and coming up with
things that I can see being useful to myself. As they are LGPL please do what you wish
with them as long as the license terms are followed.
