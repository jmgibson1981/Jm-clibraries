Expected coding format as follows

1. tabs = 2 spaces. Use space instead of Tab character.

2. separate smaller blocks with a blank line.

3. well commented. If you wish to submit a pull request make sure your username is
   in your comments somewhere so you can maintain direct credit visibly in your 
   submitted code. i admit i may do some minor formatting but have no intention of
   rebuilding peoples code to claim it my own.
   
4. Error handling. To utilize the built in prompt_fail function.
   a. global in given source file - #define LIBNAME filename.c
   b. call with meaningful message. name of file, function, short description of problem.
      the more specific the better. test everything and prompt fail it as needed.
      example - prompt_fail(LIBNAME, "random_func", "NULL.file.PTR");
      this function is found in the lib-jmgeneral.h header.

I welcome simplications and constructive criticism. Don't be an ass about it though.
